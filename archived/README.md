# Archived Projects

Paused, deprecated, or superseded projects kept for reference.

Projects here are:
- No longer actively developed
- May be outdated or broken
- Kept for historical reference or code reuse
- Should have reason for archiving documented

Do not delete - disk space is cheap and context is valuable.
